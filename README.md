# AirBnB_clone
Description
This is a team project to build an AiRBnB clone console. The console handles object storage using JSON serialization and deserealization. This is a team project to develop a Python3 console that emulates the AirBnb object management. It includes directory with static web pages for desktop and mobile first version with ARIA implementation.

The first step
The first step towards building your first full web application: the AirBnB clone. This first step is very important because you will use what you build during this project with all other following projects: HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end integration Each task is linked and will help to:

put in place a parent class (called BaseModel) to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of your future instances
create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file
create all classes used for AirBnB (User, State, City, Placeâ€¦) that inherit from BaseModel
create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage.
create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine
thank you
